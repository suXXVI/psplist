# How To Use

1. Create a Library folder inside /MUSIC/

2. Copy all your audio files into /MUSIC/Library/

3. After copying your audio files to /MUSIC/Library/, copy the names of the songs (without the extension, the app will handle that) and add them to the webapp.

4. Make sure to select the correct extension of your audio files (.mp3, .m4a) before pressing 'Add Song'.

5. After downloading the .m3u8 file, rename it to anything you want and place it under /PSP/Playlist/MUSIC/

6. You can also drag and drop an existing .m3u8 file to update it with new tracks.
